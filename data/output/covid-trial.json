Cases of myocarditis have also been reported with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n      Cardio-vascular events have possibly been highly underestimated. The study proposes to\r\n      systematically collect cardio-vascular data to study the incidence of myocarditis and\r\n      coronaropathy events during COVID-19 infection.We will also assess predictive factors for\r\n      transfer in Intensive Care Unit or death."
